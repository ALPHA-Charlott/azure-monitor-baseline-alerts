# Overview

High Performance Compute supports a variety of workloads. Monitoring these environments is critical to ensure continuity in business. Monitoring HPC workload infrastructure involves implementing alerts for Virtual Machines, Storage and Networking. Alerting for these resources involve monitoring CPU/GPU utilization, throughput/availability, and stability. Below, you will find guidance on alerts used for monitoring the HPC workload infrastructure.

**Current Version:**
v1.0.0 (Mar 14, 2024)

[Monitoring for Virtual Machines]()
[Monitoring for Azure Batch]()
[Monitoring for Azure NetApp]()
[Monitoring for Azure Storage]()
[Monitoring for HPC Cache]()
[Monitoring for Azure Managed Lustre]()

## GPU Monitoring

We are working on explicit GPU metrics to monitor to for HPC/AI workloads. Until then, Azure HPC Ubuntu VMs come with [Moneo](https://github.com/Azure/Moneo)
